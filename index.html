                    <li><strong>It is something all ages can enjoy</strong><br>
                        Tom and Jerry cartoon program contain a type of comedy that all ages can find
                        entertaining. It is a show which provides the perfect opportunity for the entire
                        family to sit together and enjoy some television. Therefore, it is never something
                        which becomes unpopular or undesirable when your child gets a little bit older.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>It is a true classic</strong><br>
                        Tom and Jerry has been around for forever. It has embedded itself as one of the true classics
                        in cartoon shows and thus there is very little change of it ever losing popularity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>It is mainly visual</strong><br>
                        This point connects to the first point about the show being something that all ages can enjoy.
                         It is a television program which is easy to understand, meaning children never lose interest.
                          The fact that the show is mainly visual and only a very small percentage oral allows people
                          to make their own interpretations about what it is going on and what is being used. Thus, the show
                           can be adapted to all ages and all mind sets.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Slapstick-style comedy</strong><br>
                        It has a slapstick comedy feel about it, which like Tom and Jerry itself, is something which seem
                         to be timeless with regards to its popularity. It plays on violance in a small scale and makes it funny.
                          It is not like video games and other television shows today which portray such an appalling and menace
                           side of violance, which can of course only be taken in one way.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>It contains a lot of valuable lessons</strong><br>
                        Whilst the Tom and Jerry cartoons primary attraction is the fact that they are funny, there is
                         a lot more to them than that. They teach a lot of valuable lessons to children and adults alike,
                          for instance, one of the main lessons taught is that it is not always about being strong
                           as having intelligence can outwit anyone. Thus it encourages children to stick in and use their brain.

                       would be the same as claiming that these prejudices never existed.</p>
